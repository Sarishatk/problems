# You're designing a smart billing system for a grocery shop that supports:

# Showing a menu     >>>>>>>>>> dictionary for product and price
# ‚¶Å	
# Taking multiple item orders >>>>>>>>>  if u need you can create a Cart (using a list )

# Generating a bill with, price, total, discount, and final amount

# Supporting coupon codes    >>>>>> if user enter "SAVE10"  10 % offer   | "save20" 20 % offer (only price above 1500)

# Repeated ordering until customer says "no"   >>>> if "yes" show menu again

# Asking for customer's phone number  >>> ask for customers name and phone number (greeting should be added)

# Saving the bill into a text file with customer details >>>> generate a bill in txt file showing (price name ,total)
